Polyamorous people love multiple people, but monoamorous people can love only one person but have causal and often sexual relationships outside of their primary relationship. Polyamorous people may not be allowed to get married to more than one partner in many locales, but plenty of them do get married. Polyamory means being romantically involved with more than one person at a time. People who are in numerous love relationships at once are said to be polyamorous.
