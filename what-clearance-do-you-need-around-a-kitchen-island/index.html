Because the kitchen island is such a central element in your kitchen, it is important to get the amount of overhang right. If there will be a walkway behind the kitchen island or peninsula the nkba recommends a minimum of 36″ of clearance from. This would typically have a surrounding clearance zone of about 1,000 millimetres. If your island has decorative doors or end panels on the back of the island cabinets, then the island should be a minimum of 41.5 deep.
